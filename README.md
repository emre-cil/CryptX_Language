## Explanations about the language and syntax

This language is basically designed to use encrypt and decrypt algorithms quickly, besides some fun features have been added and basic features in most languages have also been added. Coming to the Syntax part, there is no need for parentheses for print statements or plain operations, it offers simplicity by directly typing the operation on the screen without typing print. Also, I have no doubt that this language will form the foundations of the future web 3.0 which is open to development .D
